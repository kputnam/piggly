# Piggly - PostgreSQL PL/pgSQL stored-procedure code coverage for Ruby

## Purpose

PL/pgSQL doesn't have much in the way of developer tools, and writing automated tests for
stored procedures can be much easier when you know what you haven't tested. Code coverage
allows you to see which parts of your code haven't been executed.

Piggly is a tool (written in Ruby) to track code coverage of PostgreSQL PL/pgSQL stored
procedures. It reports on code coverage to help you identify untested parts of your code.
You write tests in Ruby against your stored procedures and run them with piggly.

## How Does It Work?

Piggly tracks the execution of PostgreSQL's PL/pgSQL stored procedures by recompiling
the stored procedure with instrumentation code. Basically, RAISE WARNING statements notify the
client of an execution event (e.g., a branch condition evaluating to true or false). It records
these events and generates prettified source code that is annotated with coverage details.

## Features

* Readable and easily-navigable reports (see [example] [5])
* Language agnostic - write your tests in Ruby, Python, Java, SQL scripts etc
* Branch, block, and loop coverage analysis
* Instrumenting source-to-source compiler
* Low test execution overhead
* Reduced compilation times by use of disk caching
* Possible to aggregate coverage across multiple runs

## Limitations

* Not all PL/pgSQL grammar is currently supported, but this is easily addressed
* Cannot parse nested dollar-quoted strings, eg $A$ ... $B$ ... $B$ ... $A$
* SQL statements are not instrumented, so their branches (COALESCE, WHERE-clauses, etc) aren't tracked

## Requirements

* [Treetop] [2]
* The [ruby-pg driver] [3], and to run the examples, ActiveRecord

## How to Install

To install the latest from github:

    $ git clone git://github.com/kputnam/piggly.git
    $ cd piggly
    $ rake spec

    $ gem install pg treetop
    $ rake gem
    $ gem install pkg/*.gem --no-rdoc --no-ri

To install the latest release:

    $ gem install piggly

## Usage

Your stored procedures must already be loaded in the database. Configure your database connection in
a file named `config/database.yml` relative to where you want to run piggly. You can also specify the
`-d PATH` to an existing configuration file. The contents of the file follow ActiveRecord conventions:

    piggly:
      adapter: postgresql
      database: cookbook
      username: kputnam
      password: secret
      host: localhost

Note the connection is expected to be named `piggly` but you may specify the `-k DATABASE` option to
use a different connection name (eg `-k development` in Rails).  See also `example/config/database.yml`.

Now you are ready to recompile and install your stored procedures.

    $ piggly trace
    compiling 5 procedures
    Compiling scramble
    Compiling scramble
    Compiling numberedargs
    Compiling snippets
    Compiling iterate
    tracing 5 procedures

This caches the original version (without instrumentation) in `piggly/cache` so you can restore them
later. Piggly will only recompile procedures that it thinks has changed in the database since it last
made a copy in `piggly/cache`.

*Important*: piggly fetches your code from the database and replaces it (in the database) with the
instrumented code. If you run `piggly trace` twice consecutively, the second time will cause an error
because you are trying to instrument the same code twice. You need to run `piggly untrace` or restore
your original stored procedures manually before you can trace them again.

Now you're ready to execute your tests. Make sure your connection is configured to log `RAISE WARNING`
messages to a file -- or you can log them to `STDERR` and redirect that to a file. For instance you
might run:

    $ ant test 2> messages.txt
    $ make test 2> messages.txt
    etc.

To build the coverage report, have piggly read that file in by executing `piggly report < messages.txt`,
 or `piggly report -f messages.txt`. You don't actually need the intermediate file, you can pipe your
test suite directly in like `ant test 2>&1 | piggly report`.

Once the report is built you can open it in `piggly/reports/index.html`.
