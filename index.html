      PostgreSQL PL/pgSQL stored-procedure code coverage for Ruby
    </div>

    <p>Piggly is a tool to track code coverage of PostgreSQL's PL/pgSQL stored procedures.
       Code coverage helps you identify untested parts of your code, which makes testing
       easier. You write tests against your stored procedures and run them with piggly.</p>
    
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>See the <a href="reports/index.html">sample coverage report</a>. Mouse-over the <b>bold</b>
       code regions to see the tooltips.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>Your stored procedures must already be loaded in the database. Configure your database connection in a file named config/database.yml relative to where you want to run piggly. You can also specify the -d PATH to an existing configuration file. The contents of the file follow ActiveRecord conventions:

<pre class="code">
piggly:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: cookbook
  username: kputnam
  password: secret
  host: localhost
</pre>

    <p>Note the connection is expected to be named piggly but you may specify the -k DATABASE option to use a different connection name (eg -k development in Rails). See also example/config/database.yml.

    <p>Now you are ready to recompile and install your stored procedures.</p>

<pre class="code">
$ piggly trace
compiling 5 procedures
Compiling scramble
Compiling scramble
Compiling numberedargs
Compiling snippets
Compiling iterate
tracing 5 procedures
</pre>

    <p>This caches the original version (without instrumentation) in piggly/cache so you can restore them later. Piggly will only recompile procedures that it thinks has changed in the database since it last made a copy in piggly/cache.</p>

    <p><strong>Important</strong>: piggly fetches your code from the database and replaces it (in the database) with the instrumented code. If you run piggly trace twice consecutively, the second time will cause an error because you are trying to instrument the same code twice. You need to run piggly untrace or restore your original stored procedures manually before you can trace them again.</p>

    <p>Now you're ready to execute your tests. Make sure your connection is configured to log RAISE WARNING messages to a file -- or you can log them to STDERR and redirect that to a file. For instance you might run:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ ant test 2> messages.txt
$ make test 2> messages.txt
etc.
</pre>

    <p>To build the coverage report, have piggly read that file in by executing piggly report &lt; messages.txt, or piggly report -f messages.txt. You don't actually need the intermediate file, you can pipe your test suite directly in like ant test 2&gt;&amp;1 | piggly report.</p>

    <p>Once the report is built you can open it in <a href="reports/">piggly/reports/index.html.</a></p>

    <h2>Install</h2>
    <p>You can install piggly from RubyGems by running:
      <pre class="cmd">$ gem install piggly</pre>
    </p>
